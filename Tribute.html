                    Virat Kolhi is 34 Years old Right Handed Batsman who plays for India in international cricket and Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League. He represented his hometown’s team Delhi in domestic formats of the game. He wears jersey number 18 which has become highly symbolic for him. Known as one of the best batsmen across the globe, Virat developed an interest in the game at the tender age of nine. In 1998, he joined the West Delhi Cricket Academy where he was coached by Rajkumar Sharma. He simultaneously played a few matches for the Sumeet Dogra Academy at Vasundhara Enclave.
                    n August 2008, he made his international ODI debut with of surprise call. In his debut match, he was only 19 years old and he got dismissed for 12 runs. Later, he hit his maiden ODI half-century in the fourth match of the same tour of Sri Lanka. Following a list of injuries of key players of India, Kohli was included in the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy. In December 2009, he hit his maiden ODI century and later in 2010, he hit his second. He was the third Indian player to have done so before turning 22. He played exceedingly well and thus, was included in the World Cup Squad 2011 where he participated in all the successful matches of the Indian Cricket Team. In the finals, he played an innings of 35 runs of 49 balls.
                    In 2011, he made his Test debut. He struggled a bit before December when he finally outshined in the tour of Australia where India had to face a brutal defeat but he was shining all alone. Kohli made his international test debut in the year 2010 against Zimbabwe at Harare scoring an unbeaten 26. He was also included in the 2010 Asia Cup Squad.
                    Kohli always batted at number 3 or 4 for the Indian Cricket Team and was always included in the squads under Mahendra Singh Dhoni. The years 2012 and 2013 went extremely well before he slightly ran out of form in 2014 and was heavily criticised for it. His personal life also came under the same radar due to that. He was a part of the 2015 World Squad and all the major tournaments since then. He was picked up as a few captaincy options in occasional series when MS Dhoni was rested.
                    Virat Kohli was picked by Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League’s very first edition in 2008. He was not been released since. He has scored runs for the team throughout and has led them as a captain for a very long period. He is counted as one of the best Indian Players in the league. He mostly found himself named after the “Mr IPL” Suresh Raina who reached all the milestones of runs before Kohli. A few seasons right before Raina retired from the IPL, they has a neck-to-neck competition in terms of the most number of runs. However, as of now he has 6624 in the 2015 innings and is followed by Shikhar Dhawan in the race.
                    Virat Kohli is surely one of the highest-paid cricketers in the world. He not only earns a great deal of salary from the Board of Control for Cricket in India but also through IPL and brand endorsements. Additionally, he has some substantial business investments which yield a great income. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that ever since the monetization of social media platforms such as Instagram, some revenue for Kohli is generated from the same. His net worth is estimated to be more than or nearly 200 Crore Rupees.
